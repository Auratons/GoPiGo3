# Intelligent Object Avoider Robot

In this project, we make the `GoPiGo3` intelligently avoid obstacles. It uses a `Distance Sensor` and a `Servo` for detecting obstacles around. The `servo` is particularly useful, because it gives the distance sensor a 120 degrees viewing angle. The script uses a greedy-like algorithm for choosing the best path.

In order to test this script, it's advised to create at your place a small labyrinth where the `GoPiGo3` can be put in. Books, bags, stools can be used. Avoid creating very sharp corners in your little maze or too small "corridors" as your `GoPiGo3` can get stuck.

This script can only run with `Python 3`.
Don't try to run it with `Python 2` or otherwise, it will fail.
